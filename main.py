# Project Outline
"""
The project Pankicakes is being made to automate flashcard making with Anki.
The goal is to make a simple program (whether gui or cli has not been decided)
that will be able to:
    1. Generate a flashcard from a given input
    2. Generate a flashcard(s) from a folder recursively and
    3. Organize decks based on decided catagories.
